magma -- MAGnitudes out of Mike's Ass 

This is a really nice piece of code that takes your photometric transformation 
 equations, airmass, and aperture corrections for each individual frame. 
The code can bootstrap observations taken in 1 filter without transformations 
 to exposures in the same filter with transformations by looking for common stars.

One particular nice piece of the code is that it iteratively sovles -- per star --
 for a color that is self consistent (i.e. with all corrections taken into account 
 does the color still work?). 
 
The "rlb" version is special coded for not having to interact with the code for the
 SPLASH Washington photometry (i.e. M, T and D51).
