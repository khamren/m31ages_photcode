Entire N147 photometry directory including all IDL code necessary to run programs within the directory.

A few notes on programs:
-- djs_* are sdssidl codes that are just efficient means of matching sources *in IDL* 
   run other things in python
-- runastrom.cl is an adaptation of that for the optical for the NIR data

A few notes on files:
-- 2mass.tsv is a tab delimited file of all 2MASS stars in the NEWFIRM FOV by loading the image into 
 ds9 and using its catalog query & filtering tool. 
A query routine in python would be great. There is a tool in the IRAF/pyRAF/newfirm package to do this.
-- .out => my matched files for various reasions
-- .raw => daomaster catalog
-- *.als => allstar output PSF catalog
From DAOPHOT:
-- *.ap  => aperture photometry outputs (photometry)
-- *.coo => coordinate file outputs (find)
-- *.grp => grouping outputs (group)
-- *.iter => iterated PSF list (hand iteration)
-- *.lst => intitial PSF list (pick)
-- *.nei => neighbors list (nstar)
-- *.nst => neighbor subtracted phot (nstar)
-- *.psf => psf file (psf)
-- *a.* => files related to an image with PSF neighbors subtracted (substar)
-- *s.* => files related to removing all stars from the image (allstar)
