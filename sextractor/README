Configuration files for Source Extractor that work well for our purposes.

The files __default.*__ with no information on the telescope/instrument should work fine for either 
 newfirm or mosaic.
 
I made a stab at changing the default.sex file for NEWFIRM -- the two parameters that are specific to the instrument
are the saturation and the pixel scale.
