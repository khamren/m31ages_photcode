makemag 

-----------
14 Feb 2011: made version makemag_morelines.f
-----------
* was running the code and had a seg fault
** the input file had 98,000 lines
** opened makemag.f; seems like the code is set up to handle 30 files of 60,000 lines each

* edited the arrays to be 120,000 lines (instead of 60,000 lines)
* complied with f95
** lots of errors -- mostly with variables being declared twice?
** renamed the second declaration of the variables
* code finally compiled, and many of the errors were fixed when the last of the 2x declared variables were fixed
** ran code on file without trouble
