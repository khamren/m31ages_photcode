This is allfprep, an IRAF code that does iterative source finding using an 
 ingenious combination of SExtractor and DAOPhot.

The two versions are the original implementation by Jamie Osthemier (misspelled most likely) circa 2000 and my edited
 version when I inherited the code in 2008 (?). The latter should have comments and explanations and work with 
 modern versions of IRAF. 
 
Most of the code is actually doing relatively simple things that are hard to do in IRAF, and will likely be easy
 to do in python.
