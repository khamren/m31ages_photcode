gprob is the giant probability code in fortran originally written by Jamie.

I keep thinking to rewrite it, but its a long, messy, and poorly documented code. so i dont.

gprob.f
=======
Uses Washington photometry and a fiducial MW dwarf sequence to determine a given star's probability of
 being and M31 giant star. gprob is the ratio of the area of the star's error circle inside 
 and outside of a fiducial MW sequence, with 1 being high (100% within the giant box) and 
 0 being low (0% being in the box). 
 
Definitely could use an upgrade. Some of the complexity in the code is just trying to use fortran
 to do certain things that are much easier done in modern codes. For example, one has to write their
 own integrator and crap like that. 

MODIFICATIONS:
==============
I would envision also writing a code called mprob (mstar probability) that does the same thing using a fiducial AGB
 selection box in a NIR CMD (i.e. brighter than the TRGB and redder than X). 
 This will of course select both giants and dwarfs, so additional work would be necessary 
 to separate giant from dwarf -- probably using the optical photometry. 
The easiest means would be to use a modified gprob diagnostic tracking the M sequnce for red optical colors. 
 Unfortunately, the separation is not as clean as for warmer stars, but its a start!
Beyond that, I would envision doing a rough SED using the 3 optical bands, 2 NIR bands, and 2 MIR bands 
 (where appropriate) that might also provide classification information for the star type (maybe?).
