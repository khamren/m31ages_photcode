Files related to running command line DAOPhot.

apcor.opt, photo.opt
====================
OPT input files for daophot that give a list of concentric radii for the aperture photometry routines. 
 photo.opt is for doing photometry
 apcor.opt is for the aperture corrections
I think they have become identical.

autopsf.sh / autopsf.uva2.sh / daophot.sh
==========================================
Shell scripts to run daophot and use the fortan codes lstfilter & goodpsf to manipulate the 
 output from PSF (i.e. remove craptastic stars).

getpsf.sh
=========
Minimalist daophot script to do a quick PSF. I used primarily on the all-filter stacked image because 
I really didn't need more than a guestimate of the PSF.

getsky.sh
=========
I think this just gets the DAOPhot Sky value and pipes it to a log file so that we can pull what DAOPhot
thinks the sky is to sort out issues.

goodpsf.f (goodpsf)
====================
fortran code to go through the psf list and remove stars that are obviously bad, but daophot picked anyway. 
quite handy, but can be buggy because its fortran and files must be formatted EXACTLY the way it wants. 
to work properly, there must be sources that fit the criteria.
in exceptionally bad conditions, this will not work well.
most failures of autopsf happen here.

lstfilter.f (lstfilter)
========================
filters out out bad sources from the lst file.
to work properly, there must be good sources!
quite handy (again), but can be buggy. Most failures of autopsf happen here.

rundaophot.allf.sh
===================
wrapper to run the scripts on all the filter-stacked files that are sorted into directories by chip.
