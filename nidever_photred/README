PhotRed is an attempt to pipeline the image processing and photometry for the MOSAIC camera.
The pipeline is based on the procedures listed here, but optimized on short exposures of the LMC & SMC.
Thus, it is not terribly robust to images with high sky backgrounds or long exposures with funny PSFs 
(those that commonly occur with wind).
